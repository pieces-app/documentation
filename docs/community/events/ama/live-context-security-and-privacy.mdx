# Under the Hood with Pieces: Deep Dive into the Security & Privacy of Live Context in Pieces Copilot+

> Live Stream Event - Tuesday, June 18, 12:00pm EST

![Live Context Security & Privacy AMA](/ama/live-context-security-and-privacy.png)

## 🚀 Event Overview {#event-overview}
Just two days after the [announcement of our Live Context feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP8u95RTCGE) in Pieces Copilot+, Microsoft announced their Copilot+ PC with “photographic memory” which “helps you remember things you may have forgotten”.

This launch unexpectedly brought many questions about the security and privacy of AI engines at the operating-system level, with many developers and organizations concerned about their sensitive data.

In this AMA (Ask Me Anything) live stream event, we’ll be uncovering the tech behind our Live Context feature powered by the Workstream Pattern Engine (WPE) to showcase our commitment to air-gapped developer experiences, and discuss the benefits of an offline-first approach to using AI to remember the right things, not everything.

It was far from easy to develop this feature without relying on traditional cloud-based recording methods that can lead to security vulnerabilities, but ultimately we were able to create the WPE technology which works across all major operating systems, operates on-device and in real-time for extremely robust security and privacy, avoids network latency, liability of data, and expensive cloud costs, and enables developers to 10x their productivity.
