# WorkstreamEventTriggerMetadata

This is a free form data object that will enable additional data to be passed into SeededWorkstreamEvent, that corresponds to the event on the WorkstreamEvent.  This is a WIP object.  Need to think if we want to do something like raw:string (that is just a jsonObject) that is stringified, or if we add specific bits of data that we want. and specific fields for each event.
