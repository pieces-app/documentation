## Introduction
The Pieces SDK is a powerful code engine package designed for writing applications on top of [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing). It facilitates communication with a locally hosted server to enable features such as copilot chats, asset saving, and more.

## Requirements
The Pieces SDK has the following system requirements:

- [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) running as a backend service.

## Installation
To get started with the Pieces SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Download Pieces OS**: Pieces OS serves as the primary backend service, providing essential functionality for the SDK. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:

    <GridFlexRow type={'start'}>
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/windows"
      label={"Get Pieces for Windows"}
      icon={'/assets/windows_logo_old.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/macos"
      label={"Get Pieces for macOS"}
      icon={'/assets/mac_os.png'}
      iconDark={'/assets/mac_os_dark.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/linux"
      label={"Get Pieces for Linux"}
      icon={'/assets/linux_logo.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
    </GridFlexRow>

2. **Install the SDK**: Install the Pieces SDK using your preferred package manager:

    <Tabs
      defaultValue={'npm'}
      values={[
        {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
        {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'},
        {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
      ]}
    >
      <TabItem value="npm">
      ```shell
      npm install @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="pnpm">
      ```shell
      pnpm add @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="yarn">
      ```shell
      yarn add @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
