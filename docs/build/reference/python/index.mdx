## Introduction
The Pieces SDK is a powerful code engine package designed for writing applications on top of [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing). It facilitates communication with a locally hosted server to enable features such as copilot chats, asset saving, and more.

## Requirements
The Pieces SDK has the following system requirements:

- [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) running as a backend service.
- [Python environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with pip for installing the SDK package.

## Installation
To get started with the Pieces SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Download Pieces OS**: Pieces OS serves as the primary backend service, providing essential functionality for the SDK. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:

<GridFlexRow type={'start'}>
  <CTAButton
  href="/installation-getting-started/windows"
  label={"Get Pieces for Windows"}
  icon={'/assets/windows_logo_old.png'}
  type={'secondary'}
  />
  <CTAButton
  href="/installation-getting-started/macos"
  label={"Get Pieces for macOS"}
  icon={'/assets/mac_os.png'}
  iconDark={'/assets/mac_os_dark.png'}
  type={'secondary'}
  />
  <CTAButton
  href="/installation-getting-started/linux"
  label={"Get Pieces for Linux"}
  icon={'/assets/linux_logo.png'}
  type={'secondary'}
  />
</GridFlexRow>

2. **Install the PyPI Package**: Use pip to install the Pieces SDK package:
 ```shell
 pip install pieces-os-client==1.2.7
    ```

:::warning

Ensure that you install `v1.2.7` of the Pieces SDK package to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Pieces OS.

We are working on a fix for this but for now, please install the package with that specific version number.

## Getting Started

First, we will create a Python script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server. This involves creating a `config.py` file to store your configuration info and a `wellknown.py` file to test the connection.

Create a `config.py` file and add the following code:

```python title="config.py"
import pieces_os_client
import platform

# Defining the port based on the operating system. For Linux, the port is 5323, and for macOS/Windows, the port is 1000.
platform_info = platform.platform()
if 'Linux' in platform_info:
    port = 5323
else:
    port = 1000

# Defining the host is optional, but we've added support for Linux in the conditional statement above for this example.
# It defaults to http://localhost:1000
configuration = pieces_os_client.Configuration(host=f"http://localhost:{port}")

# Initialize the ApiClient globally
api_client = pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration)
```

Create a `wellknown.py` file and add this code to confirm you have installed the correct package:

```python title="wellknown.py"
import pieces_os_client
from config import configuration

# Enter a context with an instance of the ApiClient
with pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = pieces_os_client.WellKnownApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Retrieve the (wellknown) version of the Pieces OS
        api_response = api_instance.get_well_known_version()
        print("The response of WellKnownApi().get_well_known_version:")
        print(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling WellKnownApi->get_well_known_version: %s\n" % e)
```

Run the Python script to see the output:

```shell
python3 wellknown.py
```

**The output should appear in your terminal stating the version of Pieces OS that is installed on your machine.**

## Next Steps

If you've made it this far, that means you've successfully connected to your local Pieces OS server using our Python SDK! You can now explore the various endpoints available in the SDK to build your application on top of Pieces OS.
