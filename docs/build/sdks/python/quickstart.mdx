# Quickstart with Pieces OS Client Python SDK

The Pieces OS Client SDK has a built-in wrapper that simplifies the process of interacting with the Pieces OS server. Here's how you can get started with the wrapper.

## Installation

To get started with the Pieces OS Client SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Download Pieces OS**: Pieces OS serves as the primary backend service, providing essential functionality for the SDK. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:
   - [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/macos) 
   - [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/windows) 
   - [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/installation-getting-started/linux)

2. **Install the SDK**: Use pip to install the Pieces OS Client SDK package:
   ```shell
   pip install pieces_os_client
   ```

## Initialize the Pieces Client

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient

# Initialize the PiecesClient
pieces_client = PiecesClient()
```

### Custom Host URL

When we initialize the Pieces Client, it defaults to `http://localhost:1000` for macOS/Windows and `http://localhost:5323` for Linux. If you have a remote instance of Pieces OS running, you can specify the host URL when initializing the Pieces Client:

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient

# Specify the host URL
host_url = "http://your-host-url:your-port"

pieces_client = PiecesClient(host=host_url)
```

### Closing the Client

After you have finished using the Pieces Client, you should always close the client to free up resources:

```python
pieces_client.close()
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use to get familiar with the Pieces OS Client SDK.

### Create a New Asset

To create a new asset, you can use the `create_asset` method of the Pieces Client. Here's an example of how to create a new asset:

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient
from pieces_os_client import FragmentMetadata, ClassificationSpecificEnum

# Initialize the PiecesClient
pieces_client = PiecesClient()

# Set the content and metadata for the new asset
content = "print('Hello, World!')"
metadata = FragmentMetadata(ext=ClassificationSpecificEnum.PY) # optional metadata

# Create the new asset using the content and metadata
new_asset_id = pieces_client.create_asset(content, metadata)
print(f"Created asset with ID: {new_asset_id}")

# Close the client
pieces_client.close()
```

### Get All Assets

To get all your [assets](/build/glossary/terms/asset), you can use the `assets` method of the Pieces Client. Here's an example of how to get all your assets and print their names:

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient

# Initialize the PiecesClient
pieces_client = PiecesClient()

# Get all assets and print their names
assets = pieces_client.assets()
for asset in assets:
   print(f"Asset Name: {asset.name}")

# Close the client
pieces_client.close()
```

### Ask a Question to Pieces Copilot

To ask a question to Pieces Copilot and stream the response, you can use the `stream_question` method of the Pieces Client. Here's an example of how to ask a question and stream the response:

```python
from pieces_os_client.wrapper import PiecesClient

# Initialize the PiecesClient
pieces_client = PiecesClient()

# Set the question you want to ask
question = "What is Object-Oriented Programming?"

# Ask the question and stream the response
for response in pieces_client.copilot.stream_question(question):
   if response.question:
         # Each answer is a chunk of the entire response to the question
         answers = response.question.answers.iterable
         for answer in answers:
            print(answer.text,end="")

# Close the client
pieces_client.close()
```
