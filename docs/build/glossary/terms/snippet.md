A snippet typically refers to small bits/chunks/fragments of code that are highly reusable, complex, hard to remember, etc. In the Pieces API, snippets are rarely used. A snippet is basically an asset, where that snippet value is held by the format itself that is attached to a single asset (many snippet values may be assigned to one asset, as an asset can have many formats that are different representations of the same snippet, i.e., syntax highlight, Markdown export, PNG format).
