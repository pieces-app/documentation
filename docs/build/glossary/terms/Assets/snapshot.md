# Snapshot


This refers to some sort of GET request to the API. For example, there is a /tags snapshot that will fetch all of your tags. There is also a /tag/{tag_uuid} snapshot that we refer to as a specific snapshot. This says we are going to give you the data for this specific thing, singular or plural, as it exists in the database.
