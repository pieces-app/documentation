Global Search is a feature that allows users to search across all of their assets, regardless of where they are stored or what type of asset they are. With Global Search, users can search across all of their assets, including files, notes, code snippets, and more. They can also search within specific folders or projects, and filter their results by type, date, or other criteria. Global Search is a great way to save time and stay organized, and it can help users to be more productive in their work.
