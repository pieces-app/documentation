LLMs are a type of neural network that has been trained on diverse datasets, including vast amounts of text and, increasingly, multimodal data such as images, audio, and video. These models can learn to understand and generate human-like text, and they have been used for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and question-answering.
