# Backtracking


Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems by systematically exploring all possible solutions. It involves recursively testing each option and backtracking if the current path leads to a dead end. Backtracking algorithms are employed in various scenarios, including game-solving, optimization problems, and graph traversal.
