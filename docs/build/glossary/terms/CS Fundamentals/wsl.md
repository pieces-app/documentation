# WSL


Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables the running of a Linux environment directly on Windows 10 or 11 systems. It allows developers and users to access and work with Linux tools, applications, and shell commands within the Windows operating system, simplifying cross-platform development and application deployment.
