# OCR


Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts scanned or printed images into machine-readable text. It analyzes the image, identifies characters and symbols, and transforms them into digital text that can be stored, edited, and searched. OCR has applications in various industries, including document digitization, data entry automation, and image analysis.
