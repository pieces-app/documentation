# Plural API versus singular API


In API design, we utilize both plural and singular APIs based on the operation's nature. Plural APIs are used to handle multiple resources (such as create, delete, and full snapshots with many materials) at once. Singular APIs are used to handle single resources, like updates and specific snapshots.
