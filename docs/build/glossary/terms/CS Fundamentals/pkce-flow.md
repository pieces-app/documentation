# PKCE Flow


Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow that enhances security by eliminating the need to securely store and manage client secrets. It uses a randomly generated code verifier and code challenge pair that is exchanged for an access token, ensuring that the authorization code cannot be intercepted and reused maliciously.
