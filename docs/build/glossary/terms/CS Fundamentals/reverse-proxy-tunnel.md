# Reverse Proxy Tunnel


A reverse proxy tunnel acts as an intermediary server that forwards requests from clients to a target server at a different location. It allows applications or services running on internal networks to be securely accessed from external sources by creating a tunnel that masks the actual network topology and provides additional layers of protection.
