# FTS


Full-text search (FTS) is a search method that allows users to find assets by searching for specific words or phrases within the content of those assets. Unlike fuzzy matching, FTS doesn't understand different spellings or sentence structures. So, the search terms must match the exact text in the assets to be found.
