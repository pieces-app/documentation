# Neural Code Search


Neural Code Search (NCS) is a method that leverages neural networks to find similar code snippets within a codebase based on natural language queries. It converts the code into a vector of numbers, and then uses those numbers to compare to other vectors to find similar code. This allows NCS to find similar code even if it is written in different languages or has different variable names.
