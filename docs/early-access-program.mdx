## Goals of the Early Access Program
Our main priority for this program is to test our latest features in as many development environments and tooling configurations as possible. From you, we want to hear pain points, any confusion you have regarding how features work, if you feel they add value to your daily workflow, and **how we can make them more valuable**.
