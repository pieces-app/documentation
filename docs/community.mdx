## Help Us Shape the Vision
We're an early-stage software company on a mission to boost developer productivity and facilitate seamless workflows across a project's life cycle. Here are a few ways you can help us shape our vision and make our mission a reality.

### <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/getpieces">Join Our Discord Community</a>
Once you're in the Discord, you're just a message away from the devs building Pieces for Developers. You can submit support tickets, ask questions, and find opportunities to participate in feedback sessions or contests - it's all up to you! The first step is to join the server.

### <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pieces-app/opensource">Contribute to Open Source by Pieces</a>
We believe that collaboration fuels innovation, and we're always on the lookout for passionate developers who want to make a difference. There are multiple ways you can get involved: from contributing to one of our open source SDKs, to offering feature suggestions, to participating in our regular AMAs.

If you have a knack for writing, you're also welcome to share your insights [through guest blog posts](https://code.pieces.app/content-partner). Or maybe you're great at spotting bugs? Our GitHub repos are always open for your contributions. No contribution is too small, and every voice is valued. [Join our community today via Discord](https://discord.gg/getpieces) to help us shape the future of AI-enabled development tools!
