title: Code Snippet Collections
description: Learn more about Pieces-curated collections of the most useful code snippets. Save Collections and snippets in your Pieces app and use later in your IDE.

Collections are a group of generic examples of language-specific code, that can be used as templates to get started in a language. We have created these Collections ourselves and have attached metadata to each snippet so that you can learn about how it works and where it came from.

You can grab a snippet from a Collection, then duplicate it to use it as a template for later.

## Collections We Currently Provide
Each of our 6 Collections has slightly different contents and a different number of useful snippets to start with:

| Collection | Snippets |
|---|---|
| Typescript | 16 Snippets |
| SQL | 26 Snippets |
| Dart | 16 Snippets |
| Python | 18 Snippets |
| Node.js | 20 Snippets |
|  JavaScript | 17 Snippets |

## Where do I get Collections?
To find Collections, you can go to a few places:

1. Collections in Pieces Desktop

    To get to Collections, press `⌘ + ⇧ + C` or `⌃ + ⇧ +  C` and a new dialog will open. You can also press the `Add snippets +` button on either view, then select the Collection(s) you want. You can add them all at once by pressing the plus button on each language-specific card. Here is an example of one of the cards:

    ![The Node.js Collection.](/assets/nodejs_collection_card.png)

2. Collections on https://code.pieces.app/collections

    Go the URL above, then select the language you want. Selecting `Add to Pieces` will allow you to add the entire Collection, or you can press  `explore` to select individual snippets from the list.

### Managing Downloaded Collections
Once you select a Collection and press save, the _only way_ to remove a Collection is to delete each snippet individually. We plan to upgrade this feature in the future.

If you download multiple Collections, the process may take a little longer.
