- GitHub Gists, imported through Snippet Discovery

## Ways to Add Materials to Pieces
When using Pieces for Developers - whether the Desktop App or one of our plugins (see an example of saving in our [Microsoft Teams App](/extensions-plugins/teams)) - there are lots of ways to save developer materials. They can be seperated into _Universal_ and _Specific_ methods as follows:

### Universal
- Right click and select "Save to Pieces" in your context menu. The snippet will be added with metadata to Pieces Desktop
- Press Paste (`⌘/CTRL + V`) after clicking anywhere in the application window

### Specific

#### Pieces Desktop:
- Drag & drop a file or image over top of Pieces Desktop to save the contents as a new resource
- Open the file picker with `⌘/CTRL + U`, then select the file that you would like to add
- Via [Snippet Discovery](/product-highlights-and-benefits/in-project-snippet-discovery)

#### Jetbrains Plugin:
- Drag code Directly into Pieces for JetBrains in the sidebar and a resource will be created
- Use `Option + Shift + P` or `Alt + Shift + P` with code selected to save a new resource

#### VS Code Extension:
- Use `⌘ + Shift + V` or `Windowskey + Shift + V` with code selected to save a new resource

#### Web Extension:
- Hit the `Copy & Save` button that appears when you hover any code block
    - Our code block detection in the  Pieces Web Extension depends on the HTML style of the codeblocks on the page. We detect ``` <pre> ``` tags and ``` <code> ``` tags to capture code and insert buttons to save and share.

- Use `⌘/CTRL + Shift + S` to save text or code from a website
