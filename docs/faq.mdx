# Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to common questions about using and troubleshooting Pieces for Developers.

---

## What is Pieces OS? How does it work?

Pieces OS is the background service that enables Pieces to work locally and handles communications with our various integrations. Without Pieces OS, Pieces for Developers would not be able to save your snippets, generate responses to your questions, or interact with any of installed plugins.

Pieces OS also enables our cloud-enabled features like link sharing.

Head over to [our installation page](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) to get started.

---

## How many resources does Pieces use on your machine?

Due to our commitment to providing a very secure experience by leveraging on-device models, Pieces does require a decent amount of resources; 2 GB RAM is fairly standard for what we offer today. We are always working to make Pieces more performant, but this is just due to the nature of our implementation.

To make things a little better, you can select "Optimize Memory Usage" in the Pieces OS menu by clicking on the Pieces OS icon in your taskbar. This setting can help reduce the memory footprint and improve performance on your machine.

    Pieces OS: Click the PiecesOS icon in your task bar and view in the popup

    If you installed via the Pieces Suite Installer, you don't have to do anything to update the applications. Pieces Suite Installer provides the option to manually update the applications, but you never have to launch it again to get updates. You don't even have to update from within the application itself, you can simply ignore any prompts that pop up within the applications and they will be updated for you automatically in the background the next time you restart your computer or the applications.

    If you installed via the standalone EXE setup, that uses a different update mechanism that only checks for updates once a day or on application launch. You will receive a prompt where you can install or delay the update.

    If you have installed via the standalone EXE, I would recommend switching over to the Pieces Suite Installer, as you will never have to click anything to get updates. Be sure to first uninstall Pieces OS and the Pieces for Developers desktop app to prevent any conflicts. Your user-generated data will not be affected.

## Local Model Crashing

### Troubleshooting Local LLMs Issues

If you are receiving the error message `I’m sorry, something went wrong with processing...` or the Pieces application crashes when you are using an on-device model, you may be trying to run a local model that requires more resources than your machine has available, or you’ve selected a GPU model when you don’t have a dedicated GPU.

Some things to consider:
1. Older machines can struggle in general with local models; you'll have the best luck with machines from 2021 or newer.
2. A machine with a dedicated GPU with more than 6/7GB of available GPU-RAM (VRAM) is optimal to run any of the GPU versions of the local models.
3. If your machine does not have a dedicated GPU, you will likely have to use a CPU version of the model, which may not offer the same performance level.

Unfortunately, if you have an older machine or one with very low resources, you may have to use a cloud model in order to use the copilot.

![LLM Crashing](/misc/llm-crashing.png)

Another common issue on Linux and Windows is a corrupted or outdated Vulkan API, which we use to communicate with your GPU. Vulkan should be bundled with your AMD or NVIDIA drivers, and you can check its health by executing the command `vulkaninfo` in your terminal and scanning the resulting logs for errors or warnings. This could indicate that either your GPU drivers need updating or there is an issue with the API itself. Please [contact the Pieces support team](/support) if you believe your Vulkan installation is broken.

To understand how to check your machine specs and select the best model for your machine, continue on to the next section. For detailed information on the difference between GPU and CPU and the best hardware for running local models, please see our [blog post about this topic](https://code.pieces.app/blog/how-to-run-an-llm-locally-with-pieces).

### Checking Your Machine Specs

In order to select the best local model for you, you should first check your machine specifications.

  <TabItem value="windows">
    1. Right-click on the taskbar and select `Task Manager`.
    2. In the Task Manager window, go to the `Performance` tab.
    3. Here you can see your CPU and GPU details. Click on "GPU" to see GPU information.
    4. To see detailed GPU information including VRAM, click on `GPU 0` or your GPU's name.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">
    1. Open a terminal window.
    2. For CPU information, you can use the `lscpu` command.
    3. For GPU information, you can use commands like `lspci | grep -i vga` to list GPU devices.

If you don’t have this installed, you may need to consult online forums for other options for your Linux machine.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### GPU Requirements for Certain Models
If you have a GPU, you can review the specifications for several of our on-device models below to see if you have enough RAM for them.

- **Llama2 7B**, a model trained by Meta AI optimized for completing general tasks.
Requires a minimum of 5.6GB RAM for the CPU model and 5.6GB of VRAM for the GPU-accelerated model.
- **Mistral 7B**, a dense Transformer, fast-deployed and fine-tuned on code datasets. Small, yet powerful for a variety of use cases.
Requires a minimum of 6GB RAM for the CPU model and 6GB of VRAM for the GPU-accelerated model.
- **Phi-2 2.7B**, a small language model that demonstrates outstanding reasoning and language understanding capabilities.
Requires a minimum of 3.1GB RAM for the CPU model and 3.1GB of VRAM for the GPU-accelerated model.

Note that as we continue supporting larger LLLMs like 13B models from Llama 2, these local LLM hardware requirements will change.

### Deciding Which Local Model To Use

You will see that all of our local models have a CPU and GPU option. Now that you know a little more about your machine and GPU vs CPU, you can use the chart below to decide whether to use a GPU or a CPU version of a model.

Once you’ve decided on a GPU or CPU version and you understand which models your machine is capable of running, the choice between which brand model is more or less a matter of opinion, as models tend to excel in different types of knowledge (general QA, science, math, coding, etc.).
We at Pieces like to use a variety of models, to see the differences between answers we get based on the model’s knowledge base and training, and for different purposes - for example, the Pieces team member writing this article likes Phi-2 for its lightweight speed, but Mistral for its quality of answers. We’ve included some links to model evaluations below, but there is new information being released almost daily at this time.
- [Mistral announcing their new 7B model](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b)
- [Microsoft announcing their new Phi-2 model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models)
- [HuggingFace Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)

![Recommended LLM Option](/misc/llm-recommendation.jpeg)

Please note that these on-device models are very experimental, and we can’t necessarily guarantee success with them. We would love if you would share your experience, good or bad, [in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/discussions/126) so that we have better data for recommendations.

---

## Non-Ubuntu Distros - Linux

Pieces for Developers currently supports Ubuntu 22.04 and up and Ubuntu-based distributions. Other OSs may work, but we can't guarantee the quality of the experience.

Please join [this discussion](https://github.com/pieces-app/support/discussions/14) on GitHub to add your opinion about what distributions we should work on next.

---

## Copilot Context Issues

If you are getting poor results from adding context, there are some rules of thumb to consider:
- Scope your context as much as possible - adding an entire repo and asking a specific question won’t result in as good of an answer as adding a single file.
- Use good prompt engineering: avoid using only “this” or “that” as much as possible, and be specific with your questions.
  - e.g., `What does this do?` vs `What does this code snippet do?`
- Try different models as they all have their strengths and weaknesses.

Please note that adding context to your copilot is something we are constantly iterating on and improving, so it should be getting better all the time.

---

## Resetting the Copilot Runtime

If you encounter issues with the Copilot or simply wish to restart your session, there are several methods to reset the active runtime. This can be particularly useful if the Copilot behaves unexpectedly or if you want to clear the current session's context and start fresh.

:::info

This can be particularly useful if the Copilot behaves unexpectedly, freezes, or if you want to clear the current session's context and start fresh.

:::

### Methods to Reset the Active Runtime
- **Double-click the "Stop" Button:** Located to the right of the Copilot input box, a quick double-click on the "Stop" button will initiate a reset of the current runtime session.
- **Copilot Settings Dialog:** Access the Copilot settings by clicking on the settings icon or navigating through the Copilot menu. Within the settings dialog, select "Hard Reset Active Runtime" to restart the session.
- **Copilot LLM Runtime Config Dialog:** For more detailed runtime configurations, open the LLM Runtime Config dialog. Here, you can select "Hard Reset Active Runtime" to ensure a fresh start for your Copilot session.

### Expected Response
After performing any of the above actions, you should receive a confirmation that the active runtime has been reset. This ensures that you are starting from a clean slate, allowing the Copilot to perform optimally in assisting with your coding tasks.

## What are the key benefits of the Pieces for GitHub Integration?

### Enhanced Collaboration

By automatically capturing relevant Git history, including collaborator profiles, commit messages, and related pull request and branch links, Pieces enables users to search their snippets via collaborator profiles, making it easier than ever to know who to reach out to or add to a pull request, ultimately enhancing collaboration.

### Fully Configurable

The context captured by the Git Context feature is fully editable, searchable, and shareable, giving users complete control over their snippets and making it easy to find and reuse code. Additionally, all the context information is configurable in the Pieces Settings, allowing users to customize their experience to best fit their needs.

### Context Awareness

Pieces for Developers makes it easy for developers to save from their IDE and allow the Pieces GitHub integration to automatically include a list of people who made commits to the code, enabling them to understand who wrote and interacted with the code. This feature is particularly useful for teams who want to collaborate more effectively.
