# Managing Saved Materials

## Learning How to Update and Edit
Once you save a material, you can edit the snippet's visible features— its title and the contents of the resource itself. Access these features by clicking the ` pencil ` icon that is at the top of the Quick Action Menu on the right side of your Pieces Desktop App window.

- By clicking inside the box where the code is in the center of the screen, you can edit the snippet directly
- You can also [access transformations](/features/transforming-snippets) that can create boilerplate code, add comments for you, and more.

### Editing Saved Code Snippets and Text Notes Directly
Once you select the code in the center of the Pieces Desktop App, you have freedom to manipulate the text/code however you see fit, with functionality similar to that of your IDE.

- Your code syntax highlighting will update as you edit to ensure you are using valid syntax while making adjustments
- You can right-click to cut, copy, paste, and select all

To exit Edit Mode, you can press ` Esc ` or select the 'Exit Edit Mode' pill, and you will be taken back to the **List** or **Gallery** View.

## Renaming Saved Materials

Before renaming snippets, be sure to read about our [AI title generation](/features/auto-enrichment) to get an idea of how title generation takes place.

To rename a snippet quickly, press ` ⌘/⌃ + R ` to toggle the title's ` Edit Mode `. You'll notice the title highlights and you can begin typing immediately.

## Reclassifying a Code Snippet's Language Association

![Reclassifying a snippet in the Pieces desktop app](https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/RECLASSIFY_IN_PFD.gif)

Each snippet that is added to Pieces passes through our language models to **classify the snippet for you**. Our classifier is not 100% accurate, but becomes more effective as it learns from user behavior. Some things to note before diving in:

1. The classifier learns based on the code you save to Pieces, so if you only save Javascript Snippets this will increase Pieces' bias to classify that language.
2. Inside the [Reclassification drawer](/features/managing-saved-materials#reclassifying-a-code-snippets-language-association), you can see the classification confidence, which is a guide to help you select the most accurate language for the code snippet when it is pasted. By reclassifying code when it is auto-classified as the wrong language, you're telling your local model to _note_ the change that you made for the future, making it more likely to classify the language correctly next time.

### Instant Language Detection Support
One of our fundamental capabilities is Instant Language Detection, which automatically detects the language of your snippet and supports over 40 programming languages:

## Duplicating a Code Snippet

When you need to transform or make slight adjustments to a code snippet you already have, you can duplicate a snippet with ` ⌘/⌃ + D `, or by selecting the ` Duplicate + ` pill above your code in List View, and below it in Gallery mode.

Once you duplicate a snippet, you will notice the `[Duplicate] YOUR_TITLE_HERE` in front of the new snippet while your old title will remain unchanged.

### Duplicates & Transformations

When working with transformations, saving the original can be beneficial in case a snippet transformation does not come back well. There is a `Save as Duplicate + ` pill that can be selected to save the original and the new transformed versions.

## Deleting a Saved Material

![Deleting a snippet in the Pieces desktop app](https://storage.googleapis.com/pieces_static_resources/pfd_wiki/DELETE_SNIPPET.gif)

Just as quickly as you add, you can remove snippets as well. To delete a resource you can simply press ` ⌫ `, or you can follow these steps:

In List View:
- Select the Snippet that you would like to delete
- Select the ` ... ` on the bottom of the Quick Action Menu
- Scroll to the bottom of the Context Menu, and once you get to the last drawer, you will see a section labeled "Danger Zone"
- Select the "Delete Piece" Icon (you can also press ` ⌫ ` from here as well)
- A new drawer will confirm your choice to delete the resource
- You can click ` ⌫ ` or press ` ⏎ ` to confirm
    - Please keep in mind that at this time, Pieces cannot retrieve a deleted resource
    - You can also choose “Don’t ask me again” to turn off the confirmation window
