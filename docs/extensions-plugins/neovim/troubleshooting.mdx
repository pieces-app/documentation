# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while installing or using the Pieces for Neovim Plugin, refer to the following troubleshooting guide for solutions.

## Common Issues

### Issue with Python Dependencies

#### Problem

When you try to run a Python based Neovim plugin, you may encounter an error related to Python dependencies missing. This error may occur when you run the plugin for the first time or after updating the plugin.

#### Solution

Ensure that you have installed the `pynvim` package. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pynvim
```

### Issue with support for Python Version 3.12

#### Problem

When attempting to run the Neovim plugin with Python version 3.12 you may encounter the following error: `TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'`. 

This is a known issue in Python 3.12 and this error occurs due to changes in the Python 3.12 implementation that affect how forward references are evaluated, causing compatibility issues with the plugin's code.

#### Solution

The most straightforward solution for now is to use Python 3.11 or earlier. You can switch to an earlier version using a version manager like pyenv. We recommend to regularly check the Pieces Neovim Plugin repository for updates that may address this compatibility issue.
