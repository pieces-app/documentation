## Prerequisites

- [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) installed on your machine.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) installed on your machine.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine because Python is required to run Python based Neovim plugins.

A few things to note before you start installing the Pieces Neovim Plugin:

- The Python based Neovim plugins requires the `pynvim` Python package, which is not included in the default Neovim installation. You can install it by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pynvim
    ```

- Ensure that you have at least one Neovim package manager installed. For instance, you can install `vim-plug`. 
  In order to install `vim-plug`, run the following command in your terminal:
  
    ```bash
    sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim \
      --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
    ```

- Create a Neovim configuration file if you haven't already done that. It's usually located at `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`. If it doesn't exist, create it using:
  
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
    touch ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
    ```

    Note: Your Neovim configuration file can either be `init.vim` or `init.lua`. If you are using `init.lua`, you will need to add the following line to your configuration file:
  
    ```lua
    vim.cmd [[packadd pieces.nvim]]
    ```

## Steps

### Step 1: Install the Pieces Neovim Plugin
1. Ensure Pieces OS is installed and running on your system
1. Open the `init.vim` file with a text editor (you can use Neovim itself):
    ```shell
    nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
    ```
1. Add the following lines to the `init.vim` file:
    ```vim
    " init.vim
    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

    Plug 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons'
    Plug 'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim'
    Plug 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'
    Plug 'pieces-app/plugin_neo_vim'

    call plug#end()
    ```
    If you're using Neovim to edit, press `<Esc>`, then type `:wq` and press `<Enter>` to save and quit.

1. Install the plugins: Open Neovim again and run the following command:
    ```vim
    :PlugInstall
    ```
    This will install all the plugins specified.

1. After the installation is complete, add the Pieces configuration to your `init.vim`:
    ```vim
    lua << EOF
    require("pieces.config").host = "http://localhost:1000"
    EOF
    ```
1. Save and exit (`:wq` in Neovim). Now run the following command inside Neovim to update the remote plugins: 
    ```vim
    :UpdateRemotePlugins
    ```

### Step 2: Use the Neovim Plugin
1. Open Neovim using the `nvim` command in your terminal. 

1. Run the following command to verify the installation:
   ```vim
   :PiecesOSVersion
   ```
   If the installation was successful, you should see the version of the Pieces OS. 

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and started using the Pieces Neovim Plugin.

:::info

Whenever there's an update available for the Pieces Neovim Plugin, you will receive the following notification "A new update for the Pieces Plugin is now available!". You can update the plugin in your respective Neovim plugin manager. For example, if you are using `vim-plug`, you can run the following command:

```bash
nvim +PlugUpdate
```
