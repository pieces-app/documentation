Using the Pieces Edge Addon with the Pieces Desktop App makes saving code easy from anywhere you interact with code on the web.

## Installing the Extension

<Info>In order to save code with the Pieces Edge Addon, you must have <a target="blank" href="/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing">Pieces OS and the Pieces for Developers desktop app.</a></Info>

To add the extension to Microsoft Edge, visit our listing on <a target="blank" href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/pieces-save-code-snippet/hglfimcdgonaeeobjckfdabcldfidmim"> the Microsoft Edge Marketplace.</a>

Once you've added it to Edge, refresh your browser, and you'll see the Pieces buttons appear below code blocks on the web.

## Saving Snippets with the Pieces Edge Addon
_The <a target="_blank" href="/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing">Pieces Suite</a> must be downloaded and installed separately from the Edge Addon in order for the extension to work properly._

To save a snippet on the web, click the "Copy and Save" Pieces button below a code block. 

- When you save code snippets with Pieces, they're stored locally in the Pieces desktop app.
- When you save a snippet, Pieces also saves metadata such as the origin of the snippet, tags, titles, descriptions, and more.

To view and reuse your snippets, just open the Pieces desktop app or one of our other integrations and scroll through your snippets.

## Sharing Code with the Pieces Edge Addon

<GridFlexRow>
    ![The Pieces Edge Addon shows the button that copies and saves a snippet.](/assets/chrome/copy_and_save.png)
    <Spacer></Spacer>
    ![The Pieces Edge Addon shows the button that creates a shareable link.](/assets/chrome/share.png)
</GridFlexRow>

When you click the Share button below a code block, Pieces generates a link that's specifically designed to share useful code with its context. Plus, it's automatically copied to your clipboard once it's generated.

This means that instead of copying code and pasting it into a message, you can create a Pieces link that shares the code and maintains formatting, syntax highlighting, and relevant tags. Your recipient will also get the title, description, related links, and other context about the snippet.

## Pieces Copilot in the Pieces Edge Addon
By using the Pieces Copilot in the Pieces Edge Addon, you can chat with the copilot about any code you find on the web. 

You can chat with Pieces Copilot about any code block, generate new code, and ask other technical questions, similar to chatting with the copilot in the Pieces Desktop App. 

## Discovered Snippets 

When you click the Pieces icon to open the addon popover menu, you'll see all of the snippets that the Pieces Edge Addon has discovered on that webpage. From this menu, you can easily save any relevant snippets without scrolling back through long pages. 

## Recently Discovered Snippets

From the addon's popover menu, you can view your Recently Discovered Snippets. This is a list of the last 100 snippets you've come across on the web, or the last 5 sites you've visited. From here, you can save a snippet without returning to that page. You can adjust the number of sites whose snippets Pieces will remember in the addon settings. 

## Troubleshooting the Pieces Buttons
There are a few reasons why the Pieces buttons may not be appearing:

1. **Pieces OS isn't running.**
 - To double-check that Pieces OS is running, make sure that the Pieces logo is present in your toolbar (on MacOS) or your task bar (on Windows). If it isn't there, please launch Pieces OS by clicking on Pieces OS in your Applications folder.
 - If you need to download and install Pieces OS, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/overview">visit this link</a>.

2. **You've disabled the Pieces buttons for this website.**
 - Double-check that you haven't disabled the Pieces buttons for this site by navigating to the Edge Addon settings. If you enable the Pieces buttons, the page will automatically refresh and the buttons should appear.

3. **This website doesn't have detectable code.**
The code on this site might be embedded in an iframe or rendered in a way we haven't encountered before! Please send us the site and we'll work on supporting it.

<Info>If none of the above fix your issue, please <a target="_blank" href="{{ links.socials.support_email }}">send us an email</a> and we'll get back to you!</Info>

## Disabling the Pieces Buttons

1. Right-click the Pieces icon in the top right corner of your browser and choose “Settings.”
2. Toggle the "Disable Pieces buttons" option. The page will automatically refresh and the Pieces buttons will disappear.
