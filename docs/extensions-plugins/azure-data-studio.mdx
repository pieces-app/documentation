## Installing the Extension
:::info

In order to use the Pieces for Azure Database Extension, you must have <a target="blank" href="/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing">Pieces OS</a>. We recommend also using the Pieces for Developers desktop app.

:::

You can install the Azure Extension by <a href={pieces_app.links.extensions.azure_data_studio}>downloading it from this link</a> or by searching for Pieces in the plugins search of your IDE.

Once you've installed the extension, you'll have to restart ADS before using Pieces. Currently, we only support installing via VSIX package in ADS.

### To Install the Extension in Azure Data Studio via VSIX:
1. Open any project in ADS
2. Click on "Extensions" in the sidebar on the left
3. Click '...' in the top right of the viewer on the left side of your IDE
4. Select "Install from VSIX" at the bottom of the context menu that opens
5. Then select the `ads-out.vsix` file and press choose

Once you complete those steps, you should see a README.md for getting started with Pieces in your Azure Data Studio IDE.

## Save snippets with Pieces for ADS
To save a query from a database, simply highlight the query and save with:
1. Keyboard Shortcut
    - Windows: ```Shift + CTRL + V```
    - macOS: ```Shift + CMD + V```
2. Right Click
    - Right-click and select "Save to Pieces" in the context menu

## View Saved Snippets
To view your full list of code snippets in your IDE:

  1. Find the Pieces for Developers Icon in the sidebar tray
  2. Select the Pieces Icon and a sidebar viewer will open with all of your snippets in a language-based list

  - You can expand the list of snippets for each language by clicking on the name of the language.

> This is a great way to utilize notes or code snippets from other languages.

### Preview Saved Snippets in Markdown
If you'd like to get a closer look at a snippet before adding it to your project, click on the snippet in the list view and it will open in a Markdown preview. You'll be able to see the snippet and its context, including any tags, descriptions, titles, related links, related people, and previously generated shareable links.

## Refresh your Saved Snippets
Sometimes, when saving new snippets from other plugins and extensions, you'll have to refresh your Azure Data Studio extension to get a fully updated snippet list. To refresh the list, click the refresh button located at the top of the Pieces Explorer.

## Suggested Materials

In the Pieces Azure Data Studio Extension list view, check out the Suggested Materials section. The snippets displayed here are relevant to your current file so that you can add them to your project with less searching. Pieces aims to show you the exact snippet you need precisely when you need it— and our suggestions will only get better the more you use it!

## Explored Materials & Snippet Insights

Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without saving it to your repository.

To explore a material:

1. Highlight a code snippet in your editor
2. Right-click and select “Explore with Pieces Insights” or hit [Shift+Alt+E] (Windows)/[Shift+Option+E] (macOS)
3. Click the “View Insights” success message in the lower right corner of your editor
4. Pieces will open a new window with a markdown file that showcases your snippet, its description, and other associated metadata.

To revisit Explored Materials, visit the section titled “Explored Materials & Snippet Insights” in the Extension's list view. Here, you can view your Explored Materials, save them to Pieces, or delete them— just right-click.

If you'd like to automatically save your Explored Materials to your Pieces repository, toggle on “Explore and Save” in your extension settings.

:::info

In order to explore materials, you must be connected to your Pieces Cloud.
