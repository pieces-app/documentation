You can install the VS Code Extension through the <a target="blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">VS Code Marketplace</a> or by searching for Pieces in the plugins search of your IDE. 

Once you've installed the extension, you'll have to restart VS Code before using Pieces.

## Save snippets with Pieces for VS Code

## Suggested Materials

In the Pieces VS Code Extension list view, check out the Suggested Materials section. The snippets displayed here are relevant to your current file so that you can add them to your project with less searching. Pieces aims to show you the exact snippet you need precisely when you need it— and our suggestions will only get better the more you use it!

## Explored Materials & Snippet Insights

Exploring Materials with Pieces Insights allows you to learn more about a code snippet without saving it to your repository.

To Explore a material:

2. Right-click and select “Explore with Pieces Insights” or hit [Shift+Alt+E] (Windows)/[Shift+Option+E] (MacOS)
3. Click the “View Insights” success message in the lower right corner of your editor

To revisit explored materials, visit the section titled “Explored Materials & Snippet Insights” in the Extension Tree View. Here, you can view your explored materials, save them to Pieces, or delete them— just right-click.

If you'd like to automatically save your explored materials to your Pieces repository, toggle on “Explore and Save” in your extension settings.

<Info>In order to Explore Materials, you must be connected to your Pieces Cloud.</Info>
