## Pieces Copilot powered by qGPT - Personal Knowledge Assistant
One of the most significant features of this plugin is the Pieces Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant designed to assist with your personal knowledge management.
The Copilot learns from the notes in your vault and adapts to the context of what you're working on. To try out this impressive technology: 

- Ensure Pieces OS is open and updated.
- To view the Pieces Copilot, open the Pieces for Developers plugin and click the bot logo on the top slider to switch to Copilot.
- The Pieces Copilot will use your entire vault as context for the chatbot. This means you can query your Obsidian vault with plain text and we will semantically match your question to any of your relevant notes.
- Simply begin asking questions in the input text prompt and watch the magic!
- Each time you enter a query, you will also receive suggested queries relating to your conversation. Simply click one of the suggested queries buttons in order to continue the conversation with that query.
- Each response from the Pieces Copilot will also contain links to the relevant notes that it used to answer your question. Click on one of those links in order to open that markdown file in your editor.
- The Pieces Copilot is also highly customizable, as a user you can select which notes you would like the Pieces Copilot to use as context, as well as selecting which LLM runtime you would like to use, local or cloud.

## Data Privacy, Security, and Offline-First Approach

In **Pieces for Developers**, we not only prioritize your data privacy and security, but also align our approach with the philosophy of Obsidian: Offline-first, ensuring an optimal user experience. Here are key features that uphold these principles:

- **Privacy and Security**: All user data, including code snippets, are stored directly on your device, reinforcing our commitment to data privacy.

    alt="Privacy and security details."
/>

- **On-Device ML Processing**: It's possible to carry out 100% of machine learning processing on-device, which minimizes exposure to third-party servers.

- **Offline-First Design**: Like Obsidian, our tool is engineered to work seamlessly offline, providing robust functionality even without internet connectivity.

- **Full On-Device ML**: Through the power of Llama2 LLM's the Copilot is fully capable of running 100% on device.

- **Opt-In Cloud Capability**: We provide opt-in cloud features on a per-resource basis, ensuring that data transfers to the cloud only occur with your explicit consent, granting you full control over your data.

Just as Obsidian believes, we too are steadfast in our commitment to provide a tool that respects user privacy, ensures data security, and delivers a powerful offline-first experience. So, feel free to switch off your Wi-Fi and give Pieces for Developers a spin.
