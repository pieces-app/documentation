## Pieces Copilot - Personal Knowledge Assistant
One of the most significant features of this plugin is the Pieces Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant designed to assist with your personal knowledge management.
The Copilot learns from the notes in your vault and adapts to the context of what you're working on. To try it out, do the following:

- Ensure Pieces OS is open and updated.
- To view the Pieces Copilot, open the Pieces for Developers plugin and click the bot logo on the top slider to switch to Copilot.
- The Pieces Copilot can be configured with context using the notes within your vault. You have complete control, so you can pick and choose which notes to use or not.
- Simply begin asking questions in the input text prompt and watch the magic!
- Privacy is at the heart of what we do, which is why you can also select between different LLMs and different LLM runtimes (Cloud or Local) depending on your privacy requirements.
- You can 'Ask Copilot' about a specific piece of content by highlighting it in your editor, right clicking, and clicking on 'Ask Copilot'
- [A familiar chat experience spread across all your favorite text editing softwares](/features/pieces-copilot#plugin-integrations)
    - The Copilot chat window has the same familiar features integrated into multiple text editing softwares: VS Code, Jetbrains, Visual Studio, Web Extension, Obsidian, and JupyterLab.

## Data Privacy, Security, and Offline-First Approach

In **Pieces for Developers**, we not only prioritize your data privacy and security, but also align our approach with the philosophy of Obsidian: Offline-first, ensuring an optimal user experience. Here are key features that uphold these principles:

- **Privacy and Security**: All user data, including code snippets, are stored directly on your device, reinforcing our commitment to data privacy.

![Privacy and security details.](/assets/obsidian/finder_window_privacy.png)

- **On-Device ML Processing**: It's possible to carry out 100% of machine learning processing on-device, which minimizes exposure to third-party servers.

- **Offline-First Design**: Like Obsidian, our tool is engineered to work seamlessly offline, providing robust functionality even without internet connectivity.

- **Full On-Device ML**: Through the power of Local LLMs like Llama2 (Mistral coming soon) the Copilot is fully capable of running 100% on device.

- **Opt-In Cloud Capability**: We provide opt-in cloud features on a per-resource basis, ensuring that data transfers to the cloud only occur with your explicit consent, granting you full control over your data.

Just as Obsidian believes, we too are steadfast in our commitment to provide a tool that respects user privacy, ensures data security, and delivers a powerful offline-first experience. So, feel free to switch off your Wi-Fi and give Pieces for Developers a spin.

### Can I adjust my privacy settings later?
You can set your user privacy settings during onboarding when you download the app for the first time on your device.

## Real-Time Streaming for a Better Integration Experience
To optimize your experience, we use a websocket connection to pass data between your plugins and Pieces OS. This means that any change you make across the Pieces ecosystem, including in the Pieces for Obsidian plugin, is instantaneously reflected across all of your Pieces integrations. (ex. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">VS Code Extension</a>.)

## On-Device Local LLMs
You can select your specific Pieces Copilot runtime from the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin, similarly to other Pieces products. When selecting the appropriate model for your environment, you can choose between various cloud and local models. To select a model:

1. Click on the Pieces Copilot Logo to open our copilot view
2. Click on the button labeled ‘Copilot Runtime’ on the bottom left of the view
3. Click on the model that you would like to use
4. If it's a local model, download it. Make sure your system has the right hardware to satisfy that model's requirements.
    - The model will be downloaded as a ~4GB file, so it may take some time depending on your internet connection.
5. Once the model has been downloaded, click on the plug icon to select the model.

You are now set up and ready to start chatting with the Pieces Copilot, contextualized by your notes, 100% offline!
