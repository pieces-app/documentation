## Prerequisites

:::info

In order to use the Pieces JupyterLab Extension, you must have <a target="blank" href="/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing">Pieces OS.</a> We also recommend downloading the Pieces for Developers Desktop App.

:::

- [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) installed on your machine.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) installed on your machine.

## Steps

### Step 1: Install the Pieces JupyterLab Extension in your current environment

1. Make sure JupyterLab is running:

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

1. Install the extension:

    1. If you want to use the JupyterLab UI to install, select the **Extension Manager**, search for `Pieces`, then select **Install** for the `jupyter-pieces` extension.

    1. You can also run the following command from a console or a notebook:

        ```bash
        pip install jupyter-pieces
        ```

1. Once installed, refresh the page in your browser.

### Step 2: Use the Pieces JupyterLab Extension

1. Either create a new notebook and add code to a cell, or open an existing notebook that contains code cells.

1. Use the embedded Pieces button to save the contents of this cell to Pieces.

1. View the saved snippet by selecting the Pieces View from the Ribbon Menu.

1. From your code cell, select all the code, right click and select **Ask Pieces about your selection**.

1. Ask Pieces to `explain this code`. You will see an explanation of your code in the Copilot chat pane of the Pieces View.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and started using the Pieces for JupyterLab Extension.
