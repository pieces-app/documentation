## Data Privacy, Security, and Offline-First Approach

In **Pieces for Developers**, we not only prioritize your data privacy and security but also align our approach with the philosophy of JupyterLab: Offline-first, ensuring an optimal user experience. Here are key features that uphold these principles:

- **Privacy and Security**: All user data, including code snippets, are stored directly on your device, reinforcing our commitment to data privacy.

  alt="Privacy and security details."
/>

- **On-Device ML Processing**: We carry out ~80% of machine learning processing on-device, minimizing exposure to third-party servers.

- **Offline-First Design**: Like JupyterLab, our tool is engineered to work seamlessly offline, providing robust functionality even without internet connectivity.

- **Full On-Device ML**: We're progressing towards fully on-device ML capabilities, with an aim to ship 100% of ML features on-device by Q3.

- **Opt-In Cloud Capability**: We provide opt-in cloud features on a per-resource basis, ensuring that data transfers to the cloud only occur with your explicit consent, granting you full control over your data.

Just as JupyterLab believes, we too are steadfast in our commitment to provide a tool that respects user privacy, ensures data security, and delivers a powerful offline-first experience. So, feel free to switch off your Wi-Fi and give 'Pieces for Developers' a spin. Who knows, you might find it liberating!
