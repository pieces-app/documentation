## Data Privacy, Security, and Offline-First Approach

In **Pieces for Developers**, we not only prioritize your data privacy and security but also align our approach with the philosophy of JupyterLab: Offline-first, ensuring an optimal user experience. Here are key features that uphold these principles:

- **Privacy and Security**: All user data, including code snippets, are stored directly on your device, reinforcing our commitment to data privacy.

![Privacy and security details](/assets/jupyterlab/finder_window_privacy.png)

- **On-Device ML Processing**: We carry out ~80% of machine learning processing on-device, which minimizes exposure to third-party servers.

- **Offline-First Design**: Like JupyterLab, our tool is built to work seamlessly offline and provides robust functionality even without internet connectivity.

- **Fully On-Device ML**: We're progressing toward fully on-device ML capabilities, with an aim to ship 100% of ML features on-device in Q4.

- **Opt-In Cloud Capability**: We provide opt-in cloud features on a per-resource basis, ensuring that data transfers to the cloud only occur with your explicit consent. This grants you full control over your data.

Just like JupyterLab, we are steadfast in our commitment to providing a tool that respects user privacy, ensures data security, and delivers a powerful offline-first experience. So, feel free to switch off your Wi-Fi and give Pieces for Developers a spin.
