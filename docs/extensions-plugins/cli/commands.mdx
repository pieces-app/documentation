Use the following commands to streamline your workflow and boost productivity with the Pieces CLI.

## General Commands

```bash
pieces run
```

### `clear`

```bash
pieces clear
```

### `version`

```bash

```

### `help`

## Asset Management

### `list`
Lists assets, applications, or models.

#### List Assets
Lists your most recent assets. Default is 10 assets.

```bash

```

#### List Recent Assets
Displays your `x` most recent assets.

```bash
pieces list assets x
```

#### List Editor Opening 
Opens the Assets in the configured editor of choice.

```bash 
list assets -e
 ```

 ```-e``` is a flag that opens the asset in the configured external editor. Editor of choice can be configured using config command.

#### List Applications
Lists all registered applications.

```bash
pieces list apps
```

#### List AI Models
Lists all accessible AI models.

```bash
pieces list models
```

### `open` (deprecated)
Opens an asset from a list or search. If only "open" is used, it opens the most recent asset. This also creates a link to the asset's code.

```bash
pieces open [ITEM_INDEX]
```

 ##### Editor Configuration:

 You can configure an external editor to open assets for editing. Use the following command to set your preferred editor:

 ```pieces config editor <editor_command>```

> Previous implementations of the open command are now deprecated. 

### `save`
Saves changes to the current asset. You need to edit the snippet code that was opened via the `open` command and then save the changes using the save command.

```bash
pieces save
```

### `create`
Creates a new asset from the clipboard content. The asset will automatically be scanned and recognized for its file type.

```bash
pieces create
```

### `edit`
Edits the name and classification of the current asset.

#### Edit Name
```bash
pieces edit --name "new name"
```

#### Edit Classification
```bash
pieces edit --classification python
```

You can also use `-n` or `-c` to change the name and classification respectively with the edit command.

### `delete`
Deletes the current or specified asset. If no asset is specified, it will prompt to delete the most recent asset.

```bash
pieces delete
```

## Search and Query

### `search`
Performs a search for assets.

#### Perform a Fuzzy Search
Finds strings that approximately match patterns. Normal search.

```bash
pieces search [your query]
```

#### Perform a Neural Code Search
Uses machine learning to understand the intent of a user's search query and match it with the most relevant results.

```bash
pieces search query --mode ncs
```

#### Perform a Full Text Search
Examines all words in a document to find matches to search criteria.

```bash
pieces search query --mode fts
```

## Conversation Management

### `conversations`

```bash
pieces conversations
```

### `conversation`

pieces conversation -r
```

#### Delete a Conversation

```

#### Switch Conversation

```bash
pieces commit -i
```
