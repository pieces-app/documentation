### Legal Bases for Processing your Personal Information

To the extent that our processing of your personal information is subject to international laws (including, but not limited to, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation), Pieces is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process personal information. Pieces processes your personal information on the following legal bases:

- When you create a Pieces account, you provide us with certain personal information in order to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process that information on the basis of performing that contract. If you have a Paid Account with us, we collect and process additional personal information on the basis of performing that contract.
- We collect and process personal information to provide you with the Services and for our legitimate business needs and interests, including the management of our user relationships, the administration of our Services and business, and for legal compliance purposes, security purposes, or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, availability, and resilience of Pieces’s Services.

### Sharing Your Personal Information

We may share personal information as discussed below:

**Third Parties, Data Processors, and Agents.** In some cases, Pieces uses third-party service providers as agents and/or data processors for the business purposes of helping us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties may access your personal information to perform tasks on our behalf. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Personal information is collected and/or shared to the extent necessary to enable such processing. Unless we tell you otherwise, third parties, data processors, and agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

**Other Users.** Our Services may display information like your name, profile picture, email address, and usage information to other users with whom you collaborate or choose to share.

**Other Applications.** You may choose to connect your Pieces account with certain third-party services––for example, via Pieces APIs. This enables Pieces and those third parties to exchange information about you and data in your account so that Pieces and those third parties can provide, improve, protect, and promote their services. Please note that third parties’ use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms of service.

**Legal Purposes, Protection, and the Public Interest.** Pieces may release personal information if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, safety, or security of Pieces, our employees, our users, third parties, or the public at large. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

**Business Transfers.** In some cases, Pieces may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, personal information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Pieces, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that Pieces goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, personal information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Pieces may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

### Security of Personal Information

**Security.** Pieces endeavors to protect personal information. We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We have a team that works to keep your information secure and tests for vulnerabilities. We may deploy automated technologies to detect abusive behavior and content that may harm our Services, you, or other users. Please note that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and Pieces cannot guarantee the security of personal information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of personal information at any time. For additional information about the security measures Pieces uses in connection with our Services, please contact us at privacy@pieces.app.

**User Controls.** If your account requires a user password, you need to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

### Retention of Information

When you sign up for an account with us, we’ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account exists or as long as we need it to provide you with the Services. Collected personal information will be retained for no longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by applicable laws or regulations. Server log information and email communications are generally retained for no longer than a period of one year.

### Transfer of Information

To provide you with the Services, your personal information may be transferred, stored, or processed on servers outside of your home country. Where this is the case, we transfer information on the basis of mechanisms approved under applicable laws, and will take steps to make sure the right security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your personal information, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing, and/or processing.

### Your Control and Access of Your Data

You have control over your personal data and how it’s collected, used, and shared. If collection of personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us at privacy@pieces.app.

You may update or correct certain personal information at any time by contacting us at privacy@pieces.app or, in some cases, updating the information from your account page. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.

You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.

**Complaining to an Authority.** If you feel that your personal information has been processed in a way that does not meet the requirements of the law, you may lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory or regulatory authority.

### Exercising Your California Access, Data Portability, and Privacy Rights

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at privacy@pieces.app or submitting our webform.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.

The verifiable consumer request must:

- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or the authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.

### Response Timing and Format

We aim to respond to a consumer request for access, portability, or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive we may either:

- Charge a reasonable fee reflecting administrative costs involved; or
- Refuse to respond to the request and notify you of the reason.

### Nevada Residents

Residents of Nevada have the right to opt out of the sale of certain personal information to persons who license or sell your personal information. Pieces does not currently sell Nevada residents’ personal information. Should we do so, we will update this section of the Privacy Policy. To exercise your opt-out right, contact us at privacy@pieces.app with the subject line "Nevada Do Not Sell Request" and include your name and the email address associated with your account.
